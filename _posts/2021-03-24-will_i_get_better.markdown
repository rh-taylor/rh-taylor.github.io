I am a month into my program, and I thought I could use this space to confront the feelings that arose while working on my first "project." I don't mean my first official portfolio project, I mean Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe. For me, Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe was a defining moment. All of this study and work culminated into an actual game I could play. I know I should have felt proud and accomplished in the moment when all my tests finally passed. I did feel some relief, but mostly I felt defeated. And humbled.

More than once I likened building Tic-Tac-Toe to running into a brick wall. Every time I thought I understood, I would begin a new lab and feel completely clueless once again. *Smack!* Another wall. When I ran my tests and all that came back was a wall of red text, I wanted to quit. I didn't; I honestly don't know why. I would read and reread my errors. I would build and rebuild. I would ask for help. I would Google just about everything. Frankly, I felt like I was going crazy - doing this thing over and over and over again with seemingly no change.

But I took comfort in something I read in one of the lessons: "Getting a new error message is a sign of progress." It was during all of this that I began to redefine the word *progress*. Because no matter how crazy I felt, I was clearly (it wasn't so clear at the time) making progress, one error message at a time.

So when I submitted my final lab and crumpled from exhasution at my desk, I couldn't help but wonder "Will I get better?" I don't know the answer to that question yet. My hope is that near the end of my journey I can look back on this first entry and say, "Yes, you will get better." Fingers crossed!
